No Elytra Boosging Minecraft Mod

In modern versions with mending and rocket boosting, the elytra is effectively just survival flight that renders all other transport obsolete.

However, prior to the addition of firework boosting, the elytra behaved something like a hang glider. The player was encouraged to search for high points to glide off of, and even had to judge whether the elytra was the best option for getting from one place to another.

This mod removes rocket boosting entirely; encouraging the player to use other means of transportation and engage more deeply in the world around them.
